# ipadAudioLooper
A minimalist audio looper for display exhibits

I designed this to be used with the kiosk app and vertically. If you want to use it horizontally you will have to modify the CSS. 

To change the text or file location for each track adjust the "songList" array in the .js file. 

If you change the quantity of files you will also have to adjust the "chaptersNumber" variable. For each audio file you will need a div in the html with an id of the number. For example, if you have three files you will need <div id ="1"><div id ="2"> and <div id ="3">.
  
To change the background issue, replace the backgroung.jpg file with your desired file.
